This project is inspired by 

100 Days of Swift (http://samvlu.com/) &

30DaysofSwift (https://github.com/allenwong/30DaysofSwift)

## Upgrade to RN@0.25

 Branch RN@0.25 is under development for upgrading RN to v0.25. It solves the following deprecated features: 

 1. Requiring React API from react-native is now deprecated. (Error in v0.26)

 2. StatusBarIOS is deprecated. 

 3. SliderIOS is deprecated.

Have some bugs on day4 and day 27. To be fixed.

If you want to use the latest version of React Native. You should use the RN@0.25 branch.
